# Strings are enclosed by a pair of single quotes or double quotes (as long as the same kind are used).
# Escape characters let you put quotes and other characters that are hard to type inside strings.
# Raw strings (which have the r prefix before the first quote) will literally print any backslashes in the string and ignore escape characters.
# Multiline strings begin and end with three quotes, and can span multiple lines.
# Indexes, slices, and the "in" and "not in" operators all work with strings.
